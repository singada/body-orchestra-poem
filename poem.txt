                                             My Body- His Orchestra

Let me be one or all of your music instruments
Strike those keys on my secret parts
Strum your music on my skin my boo
My darling I am stretched forth as your grand piano
Caress my skin as the pianist plays the organ
In symphony with a violin and a cello
Let your fingers produce tunes on my curves
As I moan out keys in high octaves

Ah…sweet sounds
Ecstasies of delights
My imaginations are blown
As you play my senses…
Play me my darling, play me my sweet
Like an orchestra ruled by a maestro
Score my senses on the symphony 
Of notes produced in perfect harmony

Produce a rhapsody of variations
In a multi-note composition
My desires are on fire, passions are on the scale
Please Serenade nature with the strings
Played on the chords of my resplendent anatomy
In accompaniment to voice as the lyric soprano sings
Pitching high registers on the musical scale
I am lost and found in this fantasy academy

Ah…sweet sounds
Ecstasies of delights
My imaginations are blown
As you play my senses…
Play me my darling, play me my sweet
Like an orchestra ruled by a maestro
Score my senses on the symphony 
Of notes produced in perfect harmony

This is our world, our dream and paradise
Love found us and we played its artistes
Like a duo of avant-garde flautists
Waiting the dawn of a new day, we rise
On the waves of a blissful anthem 
We raise joyous hymns to the Te Deum
For this love is divine, true in its essence
It filled our beings and we radiate its fluorescence!
